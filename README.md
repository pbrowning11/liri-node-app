# liri-node-app

In this prokect, I made LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Photos of the code can be found here: [My image](pbrowning11.github.com/liri-node-app/images/liri-1.jpg)
